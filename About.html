				<h2>Things I did</h2>
				<p>I am third year student and during past three years I participated in many different events.
				Here are couple of them.</p>
                <p><strong>1.</strong> Before coming to LCC I did not even dream that I will have
				chance to visit any foreign country. Well in past three years I traveled a
				lot and visited countries which are Germany, Austria, Belgium, Poland, Latvia,
				USA, Italy, Belorussia, Switzerland, Norway and Denmark.  </p>

                <p><strong>2.</strong> Last summer I participated in entrepreneurship program called FACE
				that was taking place in Hanover, Germany. I visited a couple big companies and 
				learned how to be creative. During the program my teammates and I had to come up 
				with an idea for new business. Here is a picture from our last presentation.   </p>
                <p><img src="2d.jpg" class="GER"></p>				
                <p><strong>3.</strong> In March 2016 I went to another conference related with 
				entrepreneurship. It was in the very beautiful city called Bruges in Belgium. 
				The topic of the whole conference was how to integrate new technologies in business. 
				We visited company that was focus on 3d-printing and manager of this company showed 
				us some project that they were working on. </p>
